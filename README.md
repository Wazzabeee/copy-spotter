# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Wazzabeee/plagiarism_checker

**First run**
---
On the first run you might get :
- an ImportError from pdfminer library 
``` 
ImportError: cannot import name 'uint_value' from 'pdfminer.pdftypes' (C:/.../pdfminer/pdftypes.py)
```
To fix this, please uninstall pdfminer3k and pdfminer.six via 
``` pip uninstall pdfminer3k ```
``` pip uninstall pdfminer.six ```
Then install them again via 
``` pip install pdfminer3k ```
``` pip install pdfminer.six ```


- a TypeError from Slate3k library 
```
TypeError __init__() missing 1 required positional arg 'parser' in "C:/.../slate3k/classes.py
```
To fix this you'll need to modify `class PDF(list):` in `C:/.../slate3k/classes.py`. In `def __init__()` change both `if PYTHON 3:` <br/> to `if not PYTHON 3:` on lines 58 and 72.

**Recommandations**
---
- Please make sure that all text files are closed before running the program.
- In order to get the best results please provide text files of the same languages.
- Pdf files that are made from scanned images won't be processed correctly.
- If a specific file is not processed correctly feel free to [contact me](mailto:<clement45.delteil45@gmail.com>) so that I can address the issue.

**TODO**
---
- Add more tests
- Add info in console for timing (tqdm)
- Add CSS to HTML Template
- Fix Slate3k by installing custom fork
